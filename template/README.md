Template Cell
=========
This extension allows user to insert and run a template cell after the current cell. 

## Description:
By clicking the pencil button, the notebook will insert a pre-set template cell below current cell. Template content need to be modified within "template/main.js". By clicking the box button, it will update the template content with the current cell.

## Limitations/open problems: 
- Default template content need to be changed within the source code file. 
- The update function only works within same notebook, and updated template will be removed after reloading.
