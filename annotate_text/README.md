Annotate Text (Add Comment)
--------------------------

For annotating purposes, this extension provides a user friendly system to add comment, after highlighting words in a markdown cell. The dropdown functionality creates a familiar look and feel and it is easy to use. 

**Note:** *After enabling the extension, the page would automatically be partitioned as a two-column mode, where markdown (text) cells are on the left while code cells are on the right.*

Limitations Include: 
-------------------

1. Unhighlighting a word wouldn't remove the annotation cell - users will have to delete the annotation cell manually afterwards.
2. After highlighting a word, the annotation cell will always be added to the end of the document, even if that word is located at an earlier position in the paragraph.
3. Only one markdown cell is allowed per document, and there should be no other code cells.
