Short Answer Question
=========
This extension allows you to turn a cell to question, adding an answer and a solution cell. 
## Description:
First input the solution into the solution cell. 
After saving and reloading/reopening the notebook, the solution will be hidden. 
Students can answer the question and then click the button to check the solution. 

## Limitations/Open problems left for future work:
- There should not have any cells inserted between the question, answer and solution cells, or it will break the order of the group of cells.
- One large question per notebook will fit the current extension best, there are still some bugs when click solution button if there are several questions in one notebook. (One button might control several questions)
